Hello, my name is **Darren Ho**, my email is **dah013@ucsd.edu**.

My section is **A13** and my mentor is **Shachar Lovett**

-What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

The most interesting thing that we have covered so far is how we tie in multiple topics including linear algebra, geometry, and new topics such as discrepancy.
I found it interesting how we are able to tie in multiple topics and use them to find lower and upper bounds of communication complexity.

-Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

I would be interesting in exploring communication complexity in multi-party economcis, like game theory.
I also think it would be interesting to see how communication complexity is applied in markets, with buying and selling securities.

-What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

A change that I would make, and am planning to make is moving from education to exploration. Currently we have been learning the basics of communication complexity, and I would like to explore how we can apply it more.

-What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

I would be interesting in doing a meta analysis of multiple studies to see if we can disprove a lower bound and prove a stronger or tighter lowerbound for a protocol.
